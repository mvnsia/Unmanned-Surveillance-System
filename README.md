# Unmanned-Surveillance-System
A system for increasing security at border by tracking enemies and alerting the control system

# How does it work 
whenever something is detected in the range then it alarms the control room and a laser gun is activated which can be controlled to get down the enemy. This lowers the risk of our soldiers to get attacked by terrorists.
